# My Shell Scripts

Each script has a comment at the top explaining what it does. These are all
very small bash or python scripts that I like to use.

## Setup

In this directory, run `chmod +x *`. Add `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/this/repo`
to your environment setup file (~/.bashrc for bash, ~/.zshenv for zsh, etc.).
Then, you'll be able to call any of these scripts by name in your terminal.
