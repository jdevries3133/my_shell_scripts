This gives me the shell features that are available through my teacher_helper
module. You can find it at jdevries3133/teacher_helper, but it's currently quite
a mess; poorly documented and not trivial to setup.

However, once setup, you get the following usage:

Supported commands:

student [name] (-v)
    Pretty prints the dictionary of the matching student. If verbose,
    also print the dict of the students' guardians.

clock
    Automatically clocks in or out of Paychex, depending on time of day
    and previous clock state.

timer [minutes] [message]
    Start a timer that will say [message] after [minutes]. The message
    will be spoken by a robot voice.

[no arguments]
    Run this script with no arguments, and it will enter the shell mode.
    Here, the helper object is instantiated in the local namespace with
    the variable name "helper". All attributes and methods are accessible.
